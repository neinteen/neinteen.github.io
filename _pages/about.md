Hi, I'm Jannik,

I'm a self-taught programmer, and I'm really into low-level programming.
I'll be putting up blog posts about my programming journey, the good, the frustrating â€“ it's all there. And there's more to come, like papers and other bits I'm working on.

I'm genuinely glad you're here. Take your time to explore, and I hope you find something you enjoy.
